# Ecommerce Follow-Along  

## Milestone 1: Project Overview  
In our first milestone, we had an enlightening session where we laid the groundwork for our E-Commerce application. Here are some of the key takeaways:  

**Exploring the MERN Stack**: We kicked things off by understanding the MERN stack—what it is, its components, and why it's such a popular choice for building full-stack applications. The beauty of this stack is that we can write our code in JavaScript throughout, making our development experience smoother and more seamless.   

**Diving into REST APIs**: We delved into the world of RESTful APIs, which are crucial for enabling communication between our front-end and back-end. You’ll learn to create various API endpoints to handle essential tasks such as:  
  - **User Authentication**: Helping users register and log in securely.  
  - **Product Management**: Adding, updating, and fetching product details.  
  - **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders effortlessly.  

**Understanding Database Schema Design**: We explored the fundamentals of how to organize our data in MongoDB. This part is vital for ensuring our application runs smoothly and efficiently.  

**The Importance of User Authentication**: We discussed how authentication is key in web applications to verify users' identities, allowing them access to specific areas of our app. This ensures that sensitive information and transaction processes remain secure.  


## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page
In this milestone, we focused on setting up the initial front-end structure and implementing the login page for the application. Key achievements include:

**Front-End Framework:-** Set up the React framework with Vite for a fast and modern development experience.

**Folder Structure:-** Organized the src folder to include separate directories for components, pages, and assets to improve scalability and maintainability.

**Login Page Implementation:-** Developed a basic login page (Login.jsx) that includes a user interface for email and password input.
  **-** Incorporated validation logic to ensure proper user input.

**Routing:-** Implemented React Router for navigation and created routes for the login and signup pages.

**Styling:-** Added basic styling using CSS (App.css) to ensure a clean and user-friendly design.

**Git Integration:-** Added the new files to version control and committed progress to the GitHub repository.

This milestone lays the groundwork for creating the front-end interface and interaction logic for the application.
