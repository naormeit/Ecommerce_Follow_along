## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page
In this milestone, we focused on setting up the initial front-end structure and implementing the login page for the application. Key achievements include:

**Front-End Framework:-** Set up the React framework with Vite for a fast and modern development experience.

**Folder Structure:-** Organized the src folder to include separate directories for components, pages, and assets to improve scalability and maintainability.

**Login Page Implementation:-** Developed a basic login page (Login.jsx) that includes a user interface for email and password input.
  **-** Incorporated validation logic to ensure proper user input.

**Routing:-** Implemented React Router for navigation and created routes for the login and signup pages.

**Styling:-** Added basic styling using CSS (App.css) to ensure a clean and user-friendly design.

**Git Integration:-** Added the new files to version control and committed progress to the GitHub repository.

This milestone lays the groundwork for creating the front-end interface and interaction logic for the application.
