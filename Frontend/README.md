## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page
In this milestone, we focused on setting up the initial front-end structure and implementing the login page for the application. Key achievements include:

**Front-End Framework:-** Set up the React framework with Vite for a fast and modern development experience.

**Folder Structure:-** Organized the src folder to include separate directories for components, pages, and assets to improve scalability and maintainability.

**Login Page Implementation:-** Developed a basic login page (Login.jsx) that includes a user interface for email and password input.
  **-** Incorporated validation logic to ensure proper user input.

**Routing:-** Implemented React Router for navigation and created routes for the login and signup pages.

**Git Integration:-** Added the new files to version control and committed progress to the GitHub repository.

This milestone lays the groundwork for creating the front-end interface and interaction logic for the application.

**Integration with Routing:-** Configured navigation to and from the signup page using React Router for seamless user flow.

**Styling:-** Enhanced the design of the signup page to align with the application's overall styling for a consistent user experience.

**Code Organization:-** Refactored the code into reusable components where possible to promote cleaner and more maintainable code.

This milestone enhances the user experience by allowing new users to register, paving the way for further integration with back-end user authenticationÂ systems.
