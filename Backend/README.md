## ECommerce Follow Along

## Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend
In this milestone, the foundational backend structure for the e-commerce application was successfully established. Key achievements include:

**Backend Folder Structure:-** Organized the project into clearly defined folders (config, controller, db, middleware, model, and utility) to ensure scalability and maintainability.

**Database Integration:-** Set up a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose, enabling seamless interaction with the database.

**Environment Configuration-** Implemented a .env file to securely manage sensitive data such as database credentials, ensuring better security practices.

**Middleware Implementation-** Created essential middleware for authentication, error handling, and asynchronous error management to streamline request processing and ensure robust error handling.
**Utility Functions -** Added reusable utility components like a custom error handler to improve consistency and simplify debugging.

**Git Integration-** Configured version control with Git and included a .gitignore file to exclude sensitive files and unnecessary folders like node_modules.

This milestone sets up a solid backend foundation for further development, including API implementation, user authentication, and business logic handling. It ensures that the project is structured, secure, and ready for futureÂ expansion.
